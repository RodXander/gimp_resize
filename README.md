# gimp_resize
Custom GIMP plug-in that resizes an image to 150% of its original size, centers it and sets the color of the background to white.

To use, place the resize_canvas.py file in the plug-ins folder inside the GIMP installation folder (C:\Program Files\GIMP 2\lib\gimp\2.0\plug-ins on Windows). 
It will require at least one image open to enable the plug-in, but it won't use it.
In the input directory, place the folder where the images to convert are. They can be inside inner folders.
The output directory sets where you wish the converted images to be stored. It will use the same folder structure as in the input directory.
